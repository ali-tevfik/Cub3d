CUB3D<br><br>
This project is inspired by the world-famous Wolfenstein 3D game, which was the first FPS ever. By the use of ray-casting, the player has a dynamic view inside a maze, in which they have to find their way. Cub3d is a playground to explore the playful practical applications of mathematics without having to understand the specifics. Mathematics are used as a tool to create elegant and efficient algorithms.

This project’s objectives:

- use of C
- use of basic algorithms
- information research etc.
- graphic skills: design, windows, colors, events, fill shapes, etc.
- mathematics in practice
